# Contribute an exemplar to ReCoDE

## What is a ReCoDE exemplar
Think back to when you were a new postgraduate student. You were embarking on your MSc, MRes or PhD studies that were going to involve use of resaerch computing and data science. Your undergraduate study programme included some programming and you may have taken a few extra courses here and there. It is also very likely (unless you were a computing student) that you have done any larger programming project. You were about to embark on one - undertaking that involves synthesis of your programming, data science and general computing knowledge so far plus the fundamentals of good software engineering practice... and many other skills that you did not even know about.

ReCoDE aims to bridge a gap between classroom education and completing a large degree project. ReCoDE exemplars are reasonably-sized end-to-end projects that contain the code accompanied by rich annotation for learning. The annotation explains common practice behind solving a particular task, decision making broken into digestable steps, and good software engineering practice.

Think about what would have helped you when you were at this point of your learning trajectory!

## Good exemplars

### Topic
ReCoDe covers all disciplines that are taught at Imperial. Exemplars should be either centered around a method (deep learning, solving ODEs, implementing a mathematical mode etc.) or solving a problem (variant calling using single cell sequencing or dataset analysis). Whatever it is, it should be something representative of a discipline - for example, it was taught during your undergraduate studies or it pops up in many postgraduate projects.

### Size
We are looking for fairly concise projects. The code should not exceed several hundred lines. We have found out the hard way that creating a comprehensive annotation that covers multiple aspects of a large project can get out of hand quickly. A new student should be able to get through the exemplar in one week - anything longer may be demotivating.





## Essential elements of an exemplar

* code
* annotation
* step-by-step explanations
   * reasoning including dead-end decisions
   * links to suitable external materials
   * images/videos/storyboards... and anything creative

As a rule of thumb, working on the code is only half of the story. Work on the annotation should take at least 50% of the time. Do not be afraid to be personal - this will make ReCoDE more relatable.
